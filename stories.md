1. We would like to design the balances endpoint to use the envelope we have designed. We also need to include the folowing attributes to the response payload 

- address for which the balance is for
- the currency symbol for the balance

Feel free to include any additional information you would like

2. We would like to design an endpoint that feels similar to the balances endpoint for any arbitary ERC-20 token. Please implement that endpoint

STORY: 

As a developer, I would like to fetch balances for an ERC-20 for a given address and chain id

3. Implement a test for one of these endpoints
